# 🧼 Sales Data Cleaning - Task 1

This project demonstrates basic data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas). The raw dataset was sourced from a Kaggle-style "Sales Data" file.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Excel (optional)

## 📋 Objective
Prepare the dataset for analysis by:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicate records
- Standardizing column formats and data types

## 🧹 Cleaning Steps
1. Checked for and confirmed there were no null values.
2. Verified and removed duplicate rows (none found).
3. Standardized column headers to `snake_case`.
4. Converted the `order_date` column to proper datetime format.
5. Ensured data types were consistent (`int` for quantity, `float` for prices).

## 📁 Files Included
- `sales_data.worked by shivam.xlsx` – original dataset
- `cleaned_sales_data.xlsx` – cleaned and formatted version

## ✅ Output
A clean, analysis-ready dataset suitable for visualization, modeling, or reporting.
